# CAMS CTF 2015: Impossible Salt

### Problem

**Points**: 50

**Description**: 

> This challenge is impossible. I promise. The flag is located at cdn.camsctf.com but its filename is the output when flag.txt is passed to salt_filename.  
> impossible_salt.py

**Hint**: 

None given.

### Solution

Upon first inspecting [the source](impossible_salt.py), it may seem like the challenge is actually impossible. You get a salt that contains a 10000-digit random number, right? Not so. This is because the there are two different variables at play here: `SALT` and `SÎ‘LT` (notice the difference between the "A" and the uppercase Greek Alpha). Because the latter is set inside the loop and passed to `salt_filename`, there are actually only 10 possibilities, `saltystuff[0-9]` to search manually.

Note that the code in `impossible_salt.py` would only be legal in Python 3, which allows for variable names with certain Unicode characters.

The flag in the file with the hashed filename when `i = 7`.
