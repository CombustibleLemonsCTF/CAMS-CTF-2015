# CAMS CTF 2015: Streaming 2

### Problem

**Points**: 200

**Description**:

> secret2.rar

**Hint**: 

> 2015-04-19 > By Streaming, we mean Alternate Data Streams.

### Solution

This problem was not so different from [Streaming 1](../streaming-1). However, this time around, you get thousands of additional streams to look through. Fortunately, the true flag file, `secret2.docx:flag4241.txt`, stood out from all of the other streams with a much larger file size.
