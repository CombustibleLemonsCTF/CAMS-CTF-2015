# CAMS CTF 2015: Recon 3

### Problem

**Points**: 75

**Description**: 

> Linux is a very libre operating system. What does CSC's presentation say about it?

**Hint**: 

> In March 2014, a very important CEO of Desolate Games made an excellent video on Linux.

### Solution

If you go to CAMS CSC [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBoN66yEu3Bm4UYvlvT3KMQ), you can find a video titled [Intro To Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7oe7_xgFRc) of the presentation they are reffering to.
If you look in the video description, you should find the flag.
