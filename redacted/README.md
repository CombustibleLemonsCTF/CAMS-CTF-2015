# CAMS CTF 2015: Redacted

### Problem

**Points**: 60

**Description**: 

> Black boxes were not drawn over the flag. I don't know what you're talking about...  
> redacted.pdf

**Hint**: 

None given.

### Solution

PDFs support not only native text, but also images containing text; in this PDF, such is the case. On my PDF viewer, I have an option to save individual images, which let me view the entire document without the black boxes. Alternatively, you could also have removed the boxes from the PDF, but why work harder?

Here is the uncensored version of the document, which is very large (5100 by 6600 pixels):

**Flag**: `{rhi_zo_bi_um}`
