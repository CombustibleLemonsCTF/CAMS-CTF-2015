# CAMS CTF 2015: Trivia 2

### Problem

**Points**: 10

**Description**: 

> What is arguably the smallest Linux distribution with a GUI that is still being developed?

**Hint**: 

None given.

### Solution

To solve this challenge, I just tried all of the distributions on [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Linux_distribution). The answer was [Tiny Core Linux](http://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/), a distribution that somehow packs in a GUI in less than 15 MB.

**Flag**: `Tiny Core Linux`
