# CAMS CTF 2015: Linux 1

### Problem

**Points**: 15

**Description**: 

> This is Arch Linux. To do these challenges, you will need VirtualBox. Remember, flags may hide anywhere. Good luck. Password for user 'cs' is 'cctf'.  
> CCTF Arch.7z | Magnet URI | Password: BhTHA9ch4S

**Hint**: 

None given.

### Solution

Once you have downloaded the image, you can extract it with an application like 7-zip. For this first challenge, it took a while for me to realize that I overlooked the obvious. The flag is in the `Logs` directory in the file `logs.txt`.

**Flag**: `{th1s_CH4LL4NG3_1s_dUmB}`

* None.
